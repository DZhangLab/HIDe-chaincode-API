# HIDe-chaincode-API

This is a fake API built in express framework and used to invoke the local chaincodes on the local host. 

To get started, implement the following code on the terminal

    cd express

    node index.js

  You can find the response by going to http://localhost:3000/ or replace "localhost" with your ip address.
